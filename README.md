An Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a digital system designed to securely record, store, and process votes electronically, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and reliability in the voting process. The EVM discussed here is modeled using the concept of a Finite State Machine (FSM), a sequential logic structure that transitions between defined states based on input conditions and clock signals. In this system, each stage of the voting process—starting the election, voter authentication, vote selection, confirmation, locking, and closing—is represented as a distinct FSM state. This structured approach ensures that operations occur in a controlled and predictable sequence, preventing errors or illegal transitions.
